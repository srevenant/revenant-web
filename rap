Rappahannock Station
November 7th, 1863

<div class="fic">Corporal Rourke O'Donnal thought making it home would be mighty fine, while waiting for things to start on the twilight battlefield. The War of the Rebellion had run too long now.  He shook his head with a grim smile, figuring most everybody waiting on the line shared the same thought.</div>
<div class="fic">Profound silence reigned after the cannons had ceased hurling chest thumping, thunderous roars at the confederate position.  Using both hands to clutch his rifle, he watched the United States flag flutter in the crisp November evening air.  The smoke which had belched from each eruption clung to the ground and burned at the noses of the troops, yet nobody seemed to mind—let the cannons work from afar.  It was easy enough to see: Rappahannock Station lay pummeled.  The rebel batteries were too small, their reach was less than what the Union army had brought to bear.</div>
<div class="fic">“That'll flatten the road,” whispered Cameron, standing to Rourke's right, “if it were me your askin'.”</div>
<div class="fic">They had served together for over two years in Lincoln's Federal Army and Rourke had learned that his friend ran his mouth before things started.  It was his way to settle shaky nerves.</div>
<div class="fic">Cameron spit, then nodded towards an officer on a horse reviewing the soldiers, “I'm thinkin' Stowe knows we slipped snakes in his bed and he's bang on upset, acting the maggot and putting us on the front line.”</div>
<div class="fic">When the officer's gaze shifted their direction, Cameron tapped the brim of his union blue hat while smiling like they was best of friends.  Lieutenant Stowe glared at him for a moment, then continued down the line.</div>
<div class="fic">After he passed Cameron mumbled, “No . . . it might be he isn't sure it was us, but his boots are on our back as is.  He's missing the thanks for lads such as us, helping a soft man like himself get more comfortable with the land.  A few snakes never hurt a soul.”</div>
<div class="fic">Rourke said nothing in reply, but fidgeted nervously with his rifle while the golden sunlight faded, his grim smile waning as fear wove its way through his heart.  After thinking on it, he decided to keep a close watch for Lieutenant Stowe when the battle engaged.  You never knew where a bullet would come from and he'd heard stories of officers 'resolving problems' during the conflict.  The prank may have seemed like a good idea at the time, but thinking about it now, perhaps it wasn't the best choice.</div>
<div class="fic">Even considering that, he hoped all would go well tonight.  It seemed like the brass hats had come up with a good enough battle plan for once.  They hoped the Rebels would make for an easier fight after a day of the cannons pounding them.  The plan was to come at them in the night, when things were winding down.</div>
<div class="fic">Cameron, meanwhile, forced his own smile, and Rourke felt a pang of sadness as he remembered when it was more genuine.  His friend had spun a convincing argument nearly two years ago: by joining the Federal Army together they could watch each other's back.  They were only sixteen at the time, but nobody paid too much attention.  They would be a pair of invincible Irish lads from New York.</div>
<div class="fic">His little sister, Rianne, had also promised herself to Cameron.  Rourke had no other family besides her, and just by thinking of her a recurring twinge of darkness crept into his thoughts: the factories had been brutal to his family.  But he would do anything for his sister, let alone for his friend Cameron—he had become like a brother.</div>
<div class="fic">“Agh, damn the waiting,” whispered Cameron.  “Rourke, that look is in your eye.  We're most ways through our army service, and this will be a fine and easy battle . . . Think on something else.  How about this brain tickler to mind your thoughts: What hangs at a man's thigh and wants to poke the hole its often poked before?”</div>
<div class="fic">Rourke tried to smile as an answer came to mind, but he just couldn't make it genuine.  The dark thoughts stuck with him—he felt it was not fair.  They said it was consumption that took their mother, and there was nothing he could do to help her.  But he knew it was because of the factory.</div>
<div class="fic">Rianne handled their mother's death worse than he, refusing to talk to anyone for weeks.  Instead she just went through the motions of the day, her face lost in a blank countenance.  She smiled a lot before mother died, but after, it appeared less.  He had to work to get her to smile, and then when it did come, it was fleeting, like a butterfly gracing a flower: beautiful in its careful movement, but quick to fly away if startled.</div>
<div class="fic">Glancing at Cameron he saw the concern in his eyes, and was glad.  He would be good for her.  Rourke forced himself to break from his thoughts and think on the riddle, whispering, “hangs at a man's thigh . . . right, thats it, you're a dog, I daren't speak what leaps to mind.”</div>
<div class="fic">Cameron smiled innocently, “and that is?”</div>
<div class="fic">Rourke shook his head, unable to be drawn into the jest, but glad for his company.  Life changed for the better when Cameron's family moved into the same tenement.  Rianne took a fancy to him and even her smiles returned.</div>
<div class="fic"><i>That smile could melt the most hardened man</i>, he thought softly, while feeling a bit of pride for his sister.</div>
<div class="fic">He took a deep breath to clear his thoughts.  Cameron was right, he needed to get his head on straight.  The battle was nearly on.  Then he remembered the factory foreman walking between the rows of workers, his hard gaze watching for anybody slacking while he shook the ring of keys at his hip, and the answer came to him.  He whispered a little smugly, “A key.”</div>
<div class="fic">Cameron furrowed his brow, “bollocks! you're some yoke, drawin' me on like that. You heard it already?”</div>
<div class="fic">Rourke smiled, this time for real, “Nah, it just took some thinking, you should try it.”</div>
<div class="fic">It seemed the sun set more slowly this evening, as if it too was reluctant to proceed with the night's affair.  But before Cameron could respond, a bugle sounded, breaking the evening quiet, and shouts erupted from the army around him as they charged forward.  His pulse quickened as he rushed forward, focusing his fury and fear into a howling cry that came forth from the troops like one voice.</div>
<div class="fic">The whip-crack of bullets filled air once silent as they rushed the confederate redoubt, Lieutenant Stowe hollering behind their ranks while waving a sword from his horse. They broke into the Rebel position to find it a chaos of shouts, crackling gunfire, and screams, all underlain by the fallow, sweaty, stench of tight quarters and over-full latrines.  Many soldiers were engaged in nothing better than hand-to-hand brawling.  He pulled his bayonet from a Rebel soldier's side, just as Cameron shoved him from behind.</div>
<div class="fic">Rourke lost his balance, stumbled and turned to Cameron.</div>
<div class="fic">His friend.</div>
<div class="fic">His brother.</div>
<div class="fic">They locked eyes.</div>
<div class="fic">He could barely recall the pain from the hit that shattered his arm, and had no memory of the other that grazed his head, knocking him out.</div>
<div class="fic"></div>
<div class="fic">#</div>
<div class="fic"></div>
<div class="fic">Rourke's thoughts were confused as he woke from a chloroform induced delirium while looking up at the surgeon casually wiping blood from his spectacles.</div>
<div class="fic"><i>Did I survive?</i></div>
<div class="fic">The surgeon reached down and Rourke felt nothing as the man lifted his arm, then carried it away.  A moment later he felt a dull throb where his arm should be, deadened by the medicine, and his lip quivered as he faded back into an induced slumber.</div>
<div class="fic"><i>Where was Cameron?</i></div>
